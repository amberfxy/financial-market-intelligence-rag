## ❓ Items to Verify (Based on Common Course Requirements)

### 1. Presentation Slides (PPT) - **LIKELY REQUIRED**

**Check the PDF files for:**
- Demo Day requirements
- Presentation submission instructions
- Slide deck format requirements

**Common requirements:**
- 10-15 slides covering:
  - Problem statement
  - Architecture overview
  - Key features
  - Demo screenshots
  - Results and evaluation
  - Future work

**Action needed:**
1. Review `final rag system demo | Natural Language Processing CS 6120.pdf` for specific requirements
2. Review `project-description.pdf` for deliverables list
3. Create presentation slides if required

### 2. Demo Day Preparation

**If Demo Day is required:**
- ✅ System ready to run (Colab notebook available)
- ⚠️ Prepare demo script/questions
- ⚠️ Test system thoroughly
- ⚠️ Prepare backup plan (if live demo fails)

### 3. Final Report Completion

- ✅ 1st draft complete
- ⚠️ Review and finalize with teammate
- ⚠️ Ensure all sections are complete
- ⚠️ Generate final PDF from Overleaf

### 4. GitHub Repository Cleanup

- ⚠️ Remove development documents before final submission:
  - `COLLABORATION_GUIDE.md` (as mentioned)
  - Any other internal documents

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Review PDF requirements:**
   - Check `project/final rag system demo | Natural Language Processing CS 6120.pdf` for:
     - Presentation requirements
     - Demo Day instructions
     - Submission deadlines
   
   - Check `project/project-description.pdf` for:
     - Complete deliverables list
     - Submission format requirements

2. **If PPT is required:**
   - Create presentation slides
   - Include system architecture diagrams
   - Add demo screenshots
   - Prepare talking points

3. **Finalize report:**
   - Review with teammate
   - Make final edits
   - Generate PDF from Overleaf

4. **Prepare for Demo Day (if applicable):**
   - Test system thoroughly
   - Prepare demo questions
   - Ensure Colab notebook works

## 🔍 How to Check Requirements

Since PDF files are binary, you can:

1. **Open the PDFs manually** and look for:
   - "Deliverables" section
   - "Presentation" or "Slides" requirements
   - "Demo Day" information
   - Submission instructions

2. **Check course website/Canvas** for:
   - Final project requirements
   - Demo Day schedule
   - Submission links

3. **Review project proposal** (if you have it) for:
   - Original deliverables list

---

## 💡 Recommendation

Based on typical CS6120 course structure, you likely need:

1. ✅ **Code** - DONE
2. ✅ **Report** - DONE (1st draft)
3. ❓ **Presentation Slides** - CHECK PDF REQUIREMENTS
4. ❓ **Demo Day** - CHECK PDF REQUIREMENTS

**Action:** Open the PDF files and search for "presentation", "slides", "demo", "deliverables" to confirm.
